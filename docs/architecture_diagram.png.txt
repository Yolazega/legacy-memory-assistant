# Architecture Diagram Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the system architecture diagram.

The diagram should illustrate:
- Jetson Orin NX for local processing
- PC backend for heavy computation
- Audio input pipeline (microphone → ASR → emotion detection)
- Memory storage (encrypted SQLite + vector embeddings)
- Avatar interface (TTS + visual representation)
- User access control and privacy layers

To create the actual diagram:
1. Use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or Mermaid
2. Show data flow between components
3. Highlight privacy and security boundaries
4. Include optional cloud sync pathway
5. Save as PNG and replace this file

Recommended tools:
- draw.io (free, web-based)
- Mermaid (code-based diagrams)
- Figma (for more polished visuals)
- PlantUML (for technical diagrams)
